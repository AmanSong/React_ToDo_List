This is my third React project. It is merely just a simple to do list, but this time i did not follow any tutorial, although lots of googling and stack overflow was needed. Css was done manually and i believed it turned out quite nice looking. Its not the most difficult application but i feel better that i can code something without following a tutorial word for word.
